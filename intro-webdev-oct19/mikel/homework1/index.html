<h3>My talents</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered what I'm good at?
	I am good at the following:<br />
	I'm good at driving... or not hitting stuff.<br />
 	I'm good at watching football, soccer, baseball, etc.<br />
	I'm good at lots of additional stuff... That I just don't remember at this point.<br />
</p>


<p>What I want to become good at</p>
<p>In this paragraph, I want you to describe the things you want to be good at and what you think you need in order to achieve the goal. Put each item on a separate line. Also, add a class in front of each short description called “dreams”. An example:
	I want to be good at the following:<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Soccer.</div> I can teach and play soccer with the kids in our backyard.<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Coding.</div> I can have joined this class at Interface Web School.<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Soap Box Derby.</div> My kids like to travel to Kansas City or Des Moines to race.<br />
<div class=”dreams” >Exercising.</div> I make a commitment to visit a gym once per month - :).<br />
